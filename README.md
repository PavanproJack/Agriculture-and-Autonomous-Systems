# Fruit Detection in Orchards -- (Latest Updates go first)

####  Yolo-v5 Object detection model ---  Update : 11th July 2020  

Here are some insights I gathered after testing:

Both of them showed the same detection results with the test dataset although yolov5 was faster. But in very a few images yolov4 captured the occluded mangos very well.

When tested on data outside the test dataset, yolov4 has good detection results relatively.

Yolo v4 tiny detections to the left and that of Yolov5 to the right.
