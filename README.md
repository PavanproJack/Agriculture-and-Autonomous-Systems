# Fruit Detection in Orchards -- (Latest Updates go first)

####  Yolo-v5 Object detection model ---  Update : 11th July 2020  

It includes 1354 images.
Mangos are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -19 and +19 degrees
* Random shear of between -7째 to +7째 horizontally and -31째 to +31째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
